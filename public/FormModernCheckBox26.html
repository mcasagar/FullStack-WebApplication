            <h2>Our terms and Conditions</h2>
            <p>Depending on how you obtained the Windows software, this is a license agreement between (i) you and the
                device manufacturer or software installer that distributes the software with your device; or (ii) you
                and Microsoft Corporation (or, based on where you live or, if a business, where your principal place of
                business is located, one of its affiliates) if you acquired the software from a retailer. Microsoft is
                the device manufacturer for devices produced by Microsoft or one of its affiliates, and Microsoft is the
                retailer if you acquired the software directly from Microsoft. Note that if you are a volume license
                customer, use of this software is subject to your volume license agreement rather than this agreement.
